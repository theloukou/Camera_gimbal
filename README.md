# 2-axis Camera Gimbal
Arduino-based 2-axis BLDC gimbal controller

This project consists the main study of my Thesis for my Bachelor of Science at the Department of Automation Engineering of the Piraeus University of Applied Sciences.

It is an Arduino Mega2560 based system, that consists of an extention PCB(shield) that acts as a motor driver for BLCD motors, and an interface between the Arduino and its peripheral devices (motor drivers, IMUs, switches, battery).
Microcontroller code is presented, as well as shield schematic/PCB layout/PCB Gerbers. Also, some 3D-Printed parts used around the gimbal frame are presented in STL form.
